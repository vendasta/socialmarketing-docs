Social Marketing can help you post to all of your most important social media accounts. These do, however, have specific requirements to post.

**Video Thumbnail:**

When uploading a video for pages through Social Marketing we publish the video as the user uploads it in the composer, so the thumbnail is taken from the first frame of the video. Currently, we do not have the option to set a thumbnail on the platform.

You can try to edit the video using [CapCut](https://www.capcut.com/) or any video editor to add a thumbnail.
