# Composer Spell Check

Social Marketing's composer includes built-in spell checking to help ensure your posts are error-free before publishing.

## Spell Check Features

The composer automatically checks your text for spelling and grammar errors as you type, helping you maintain professional-quality content across all your social media posts.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: The spell checker identifies potential errors in real-time
2. **Error Highlighting**: Misspelled words are highlighted for easy identification
3. **Correction Suggestions**: Right-click on highlighted words for correction options
4. **Grammar Checking**: Basic grammar errors are also detected and flagged

## Browser Extensions

For enhanced spell checking, you can install browser extensions like Grammarly:

1. **Install Extension**: Add Grammarly or similar extensions to your browser
2. **Enable for Social Marketing**: The extension will work within the composer
3. **Enhanced Checking**: Get more comprehensive grammar and style suggestions

## Best Practices

- **Review Before Posting**: Always review your content before scheduling or publishing
- **Use Extensions**: Consider using browser extensions for enhanced spell checking
- **Proofread**: Take time to proofread important posts, especially for business accounts

**Note:** While spell checkers are helpful, they may not catch all errors, so manual review is always recommended.
