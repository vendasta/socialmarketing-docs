## What is the Social Marketing Composer?

The **Social Marketing Composer** helps you create, schedule, and manage social media content across multiple platforms in one place. Whether you are posting a single update or running a campaign, the Composer provides the tools you need to customize each post for every network.

## Why is the Composer important?

This tool allows you to:

- Publish to multiple social accounts at once  
- Customize content for different platforms  
- Schedule posts in advance or save them as drafts  
- Ensure each post meets platform requirements and limits  
- Improve writing quality with grammar tools  

## How to Compose a Post

1. Go to `Social Marketing`.  
2. Click `Compose` or `Create`.  
3. **Choose Social Accounts** under the `Post to` section.  
   - You can select multiple social accounts across platforms.  
   - Only **one X (Twitter)** account can be selected per post due to X’s publishing rules.  
   - Posts cannot be scheduled or published to **expired accounts**.  
4. **Write Content** under the `Content` field:  
   - Use `Write with AI` to generate post text.  
   - Shorten links to track performance or fit character limits on X (Twitter).  
   - Add emojis, hashtags, or tagged accounts.  
   - Insert content from RSS feeds or curated sources.  
   - Save posts as templates for future use, or apply existing templates.  
   - Use `Customize by Account` to adjust text for different platforms.  
5. **Add Media**  
   - Upload your own images or videos.  
   - Use `Stock Imagery` or `Generate Image with AI`.  
   - Instagram requires an image; TikTok requires a video.  
6. **Schedule or Publish**  
   - Choose `Post Now`, `Schedule`, or `Save as Draft`.
