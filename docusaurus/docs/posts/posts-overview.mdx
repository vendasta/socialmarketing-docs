## What is the Social Marketing Composer?

The **Social Marketing composer** helps you create, schedule, and manage social media content across multiple platforms in one place. Whether you are posting a single update or running a campaign, the composer provides the tools you need to customize each post for every network.

## Why is the composer important?

This tool allows you to:

- Publish to multiple social accounts at once  
- Customize content for different platforms  
- Schedule posts in advance or save them as drafts  
- Ensure each post meets platform requirements and limits  
- Improve writing quality with grammar tools  

## How to compose a post

1. Go to `Social Marketing`.  
2. Click `compose` or `create`.  
3. **Choose Social Accounts** under the `post to` section.  
   - You can select multiple social accounts across platforms.  
   - Only **one X (Twitter)** account can be selected per post due to X’s publishing rules.  
   - Posts cannot be scheduled or published to **expired accounts**.  
4. **Write content** under the `content` field:  
   - Use `write with AI` to generate post text.  
   - Shorten links to track performance or fit character limits on X (Twitter).  
   - Add emojis, hashtags, or tagged accounts.  
   - Insert content from RSS feeds or curated sources.  
   - Save posts as templates for future use, or apply existing templates.  
   - Use `customize by account` to adjust text for different platforms.  
5. **Add media**  
   - Upload your own images or videos.  
   - Use `stock imagery` or `generate image with AI`.  
   - Instagram requires an image; TikTok requires a video.  
6. **Schedule or publish**  
   - Choose `post Now`, `schedule`, or `save as draft`.
