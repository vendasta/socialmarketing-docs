# Share Reviews as Social Post Images

Users of both Reputation Management and Social Marketing can share their reviews pulled in through Reputation Management as images in Social Marketing.

Reviews can make or break a business. By sharing positive reviews from satisfied customers as beautiful images, businesses are able to better showcase and prove their abilities. Fans of that business are more likely to interact with an image in comparison to clicking a link and reading a review on a third-party site.

### How to share reviews as social posts

In Reputation Management, when a user would like to share a positive review they can easily click the share button and select "Share on Social".

This will take the user into Social Marketing and pre-populate the composer with an image showcasing the review.
