# Customizing Social Media Posts by Network

Social Marketing empowers you to tailor your social media posts for each platform individually, ensuring your content aligns with each network's unique standards, audience expectations, and technical requirements. This helps maximize engagement, performance, and reach.

## Why Customize Posts by Network?

Each social network—like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and Instagram—has its own formatting guidelines and audience behaviors. A one-size-fits-all approach often results in missed opportunities or even failed posts. Customizing posts ensures:

- Content is accepted by all networks  
- Messaging resonates with platform-specific audiences  
- Engagement is optimized by adjusting timing and media

## Network-Specific Customization in Social Marketing

Social Marketing makes it simple to customize posts for multiple platforms through the **“Customize by Account”** feature. This allows you to adjust content, visuals, and scheduling per network—all from one place.

### Content Customization

- **Hashtag Optimization:** Use platform-relevant hashtags and mentions  
- **Call-to-Action (CTA):** Match CTA style with platform norms and user behavior  

### Visual Customization

- **Image Sizing:** Automatically or manually adjust image dimensions per network

- **Media Selection:** Choose distinct media files for different platforms if needed  

### Timing Optimization

## Validating Posts by Network Standards

Each platform has strict validation rules—character limits, image/video sizes, link formats, etc. With Social Marketing’s validation engine:

- Your posts are automatically checked for compliance  
- Content is formatted to meet the requirements of each selected network  
- Errors are minimized, and posts are published successfully across all platforms  

To activate this, simply check **“Customize by Account”** when composing a post. The system will then tailor the post format per platform.

## Post Grouping for Easy Management

Social Marketing lets you **group posts by network**, making it easier to manage content streams. You can edit or schedule grouped posts collectively or individually—streamlining workflow while retaining customization.

- **Do Your Research:** Understand what content works on each platform  
- **Adapt Thoughtfully:** Keep your core message but tweak tone and format  
- **Maintain Brand Consistency:** Ensure logos, color schemes, and voice stay uniform  
- **Track Performance:** Use analytics to refine your approach over time
