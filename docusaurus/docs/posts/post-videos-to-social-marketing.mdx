# FAQs

<details>
<summary>Why doesn't my video show in the post preview box of Social Marketing?</summary>

Sometimes videos that match all the file requirements to post fail to populate in the preview box. Typically, this is due to the formatting decisions of the content provider and can be easily fixed by reformatting the video.

### Reformatting Video File

The two formats that our Social Marketing app supports are:

- .mov
- .mp4

You can get good results by using the defaults and presets with programs like:

- iMovie
- Handbrake
- Canva

Simply save the video that you want to post. "Import" the video into one of these programs and then "export" or "share" the video – the new file produced should meet all requirements to post in Social Marketing!
