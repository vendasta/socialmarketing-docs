Social Marketing users are able to upload and publish video content on X. 

Posts with video receive vastly more engagement than those without. By uploading videos, content will be more engaging, resulting in better traction and viewer interaction.

### How does posting video to X work?

Users can upload a .mp4 or .mov video that is a maximum of 60 seconds in length through the Social Marketing composer. Once uploaded they will be able to publish or schedule the video post. 

Social Marketing users are able to post videos on X, Instagram, and Facebook at the same time. 

All Social Marketing users will have access to this feature.
