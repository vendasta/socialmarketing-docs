## What is the add post feature?

The **Add Another Post** feature allows you to generate additional AI-created posts directly within the Post Campaign workflow. You can now go beyond the preset options of 3, 6, 9, or 12 posts, up to a maximum of 20 posts per campaign, without restarting the process. This makes it easier to seamlessly create more content within a campaign.

## Why is adding posts important?

This feature helps you:

- Extend campaigns without starting over  
- Save time by generating extra content instantly  
- Maintain consistency across all posts in a campaign  
- Improve content scalability for ongoing campaigns  

By using AI, you can quickly fill out campaign calendars or adjust content volumes based on new needs.

## What’s included in the add post feature?

- An 'Add Another Post' button in step 2 of the Post Campaign workflow  
- AI-driven generation of additional posts based on your existing topic  
- Support for up to 20 total posts per campaign  
- Seamless integration with the existing campaign content  

## How to use the add post feature
