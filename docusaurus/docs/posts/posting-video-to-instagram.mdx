Social Marketing users can publish video content on Instagram.

Posts with video receive vastly more engagement than those without. By uploading videos, content will be more engaging, resulting in better traction and viewer interaction.

### **How does posting a video to Instagram work?**

Users can upload a .mp4 or .mov video that is a maximum of **60 seconds** in length through the Social Marketing composer.

**Videos posted through Social Marketing will automatically post as a Reel.**
