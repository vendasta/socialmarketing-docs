# Instagram Reels

## Note
You cannot create Reels within Social Marketing the same way you can in the Instagram app. You cannot add music, effects, or create Reels from single or multiple images. What you can do is upload a video (under 90 seconds) and schedule it to Instagram—Instagram will publish it as a Reel automatically.

## Getting Started

Reels are Instagram’s version of short-form, vertical video content—similar to TikToks. They can be up to 90 seconds long and support features like music, AR effects, and on-screen text when created natively in the Instagram app.
Reels are permanent (unless deleted), unlike Stories which disappear after 24 hours. If your account is public, Reels may be shown in the Explore feed, giving you potential exposure to a broader audience.

Reels enable Instagram users to create engaging and entertaining short-form videos. While designed for mobile creation, Vendasta enables users to create and schedule this native video format for their clients via desktop!

## Uploading Reels Through Social Marketing 

While Social Marketing doesn’t allow you to create Reels directly (no music, no filters, no effects), you can upload videos that will be automatically published as Reels by Instagram. Here’s how:

1. Start a new post in Social Marketing. Ensure you have selected Instagram as your platform from the platform dropdown.
2. Upload a video (must be under 90 seconds). If your video is above 90 seconds, you will have to trim it before uploading it to Social Marketing.
3. Add your caption, hashtags, and mentions.
4. Choose your publishing option: Post Now, Schedule, or Draft.

:::tip
Ensure that your Instagram account is connected to a Facebook page and that you're using a Professional account (Business or Creator).

## Best Practices for Instagram Reels

1. **Keep it short and engaging**: While Reels can be up to 90 seconds, shorter videos often perform better. Aim for 15-30 seconds of high-quality, engaging content.

2. **Use trending audio**: Incorporate popular songs or trending audio clips to increase the likelihood of your Reel being discovered.

3. **Utilize text and captions**: Add text overlays to your Reels to communicate key messages, especially since many users watch without sound.

4. **Incorporate hashtags**: Use relevant hashtags to help your Reel reach more people. Include trending hashtags where appropriate.

5. **Create high-quality content**: Ensure your Reels are well-lit and clearly visible. Avoid using content that's too blurry or low-resolution.

6. **Be authentic**: Showcase your brand's personality and values through your Reels. Authentic content tends to resonate more with audiences.

7. **Post consistently**: Regular posting helps keep your audience engaged and signals to the Instagram algorithm that you're an active user.

8. **Analyze performance**: Pay attention to which Reels perform well and try to understand why, then replicate those elements in future content.
