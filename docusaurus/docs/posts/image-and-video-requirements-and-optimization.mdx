## Image Optimization and Cropping

When uploading images, it's crucial to meet the platform-specific **aspect ratio** requirements. Failure to do so may result in cropping errors or distorted visuals.

### How It Works

- If an image doesn't meet the required aspect ratio, an **error message** prompts users to crop the image.
- Use the cropping tool to choose from:
  - **Freeform**
  - **Square (1:1)**
  - **Vertical (4:5)**
  - **Horizontal (1.91:1)**

This helps ensure images stay in-frame, look professional, and follow best practices for engagement.

### Google Business Profile Notice

> "On submission, Google Business will scale the image resolution slightly without a perceptible loss in quality."

By leveraging our enhanced cropping tool, you’ll maintain your image quality, maximize engagement, and showcase your brand effectively.
