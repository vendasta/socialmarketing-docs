Each social network has its own definition of what it sets as an [acceptable standard](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-social-marketing/acceptable-social-posts-standards) for posts. These standards vary widely based on the network and include things such as character length, image formats, and sizes, video formats and lengths, and much more.

Clients with Social Marketing can post at one time in acceptable formats for all of the social networks they wish to share content by simply selecting the "customize by account" feature.

### Why are network validations important?

Clients selecting this feature when composing posts will have their content versioned for each of the social networks based on the network's accepted formats. This helps clients successfully post on social media networks easily, and efficiently, and most importantly reduces user formatting errors by meeting the differing requirements of each social network.

### How do I access network validations?

When in the composer and adding content for posts, select "customized by accounts" so that the composer will customize this post to be presented on multiple social media networks. By selecting this option, post content will meet the differing requirements of each social network and post successfully without any content-related formatting errors.
