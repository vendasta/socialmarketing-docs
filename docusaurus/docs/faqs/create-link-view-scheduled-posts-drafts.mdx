# Create a link to view scheduled posts and drafts

You can create shareable links to view your scheduled posts and drafts in Social Marketing.

## Creating a Report Link

1. Go to **Social Marketing > Posts**
2. Click on the **Reports** tab
3. Click **Create Report Link**
4. Configure the report settings:
   - Select the date range
   - Choose which networks to include
   - Set access permissions
5. Click **Generate Link**

The generated link can be shared with team members or clients to view your scheduled posts and drafts without requiring direct access to your Social Marketing account.

**Note:** Report links have expiration dates and access controls for security.
