# Why is Google deleting your Google Business Profile posts?

Google Business Profile will delete posts if they violate Google's posting rules. The most common issues include posts that contain one or more of the following:

- Phone numbers
- Content not directly relevant to the business
- Content related to regulated products and services (alcohol, tobacco, gambling, financial services, pharmaceuticals, health, etc.)
- Content related to the sale of dangerous or illegal products, services, or activities (fireworks, recreational drugs, weapons, etc.)
