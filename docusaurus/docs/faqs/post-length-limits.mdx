While not all social networks are designed with strict character limits like X, it's still important for posts to maintain a readable length.

When posting to multiple networks, the Social Marketing Composer will limit your post according to the network with the lowest limit. The character count of your post is tracked above the Content box in the Composer.

**Here are the character limits for each social network:**

| Network | Facebook | X | LinkedIn | Instagram | Google Business Profile |
|:-------:|:--------:|:--:|:--------:|:---------:|:-----------------------:|
| **Character limit** | 63,206 | 280 | 700 | 2,200 | 1,500 |
