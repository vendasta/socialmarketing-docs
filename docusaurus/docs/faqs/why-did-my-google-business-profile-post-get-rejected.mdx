# Why did my Google Business Profile (GBP) post get rejected?

Posts are often rejected due to the content of the post, the photo/image being used, or if the business is in a "sensitive" topic area.

Sometimes words within the post will trigger the rejection of a post. The word may seem benign, but it may be on Google's "offensive" word list (rejected posts are controlled on Google's end and **not** by Social Marketing.)

If your post gets rejected, try re-wording to a more generic body copy, and don't include any sensitive words or images.

Previously, it was acceptable to include your phone number or a website URL in the body of a post. Google is now rejecting many posts with phone numbers or URLs. So if your post is rejected, try taking those elements out.
