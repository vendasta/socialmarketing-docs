**Yes, for some channels.** If you delete a post from Social Marketing, in most instances, it will be deleted from the social platform as well:

- **Facebook, LinkedIn, X, Google Business Profile** - If you delete a post in the Social Marketing App, the post will also be deleted on the source pages.

- **Instagram** - Deleting an Instagram post isn't possible through a Social Marketing App. You'll need to go directly to Instagram to remove it.
