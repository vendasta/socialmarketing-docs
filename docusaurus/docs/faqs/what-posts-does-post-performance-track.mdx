Social Marketing tracks post performance data on all posts made through the app and in some instances, posts made outside of the product.

Social Marketing pulls in historical data and post-performance for posts made organically through Facebook\*, X\*\*, and Instagram (from the moment it became a business profile) or another social media publisher.

\*\*Due to Facebook API restrictions, only data from the last 100 posts made before the connection date will be reported within Social Marketing.\*\*

\*\*Due to X API limitations we support the last 10 posts for an active user (an active user is defined as having made at least one post in the last month)\*\*
