# Grey Facebook account

A grey Facebook account typically indicates that the account has limited functionality or is in a restricted state. This can happen for several reasons:

## Common Causes

- **Account verification issues**: The account may need additional verification
- **Policy violations**: The account may have violated Facebook's community standards
- **Suspicious activity**: Facebook may have detected unusual activity
- **Incomplete setup**: The account may not be fully configured

## How to Resolve

1. **Check account status**: Log into Facebook and check for any notifications or warnings
2. **Complete verification**: Follow any verification steps Facebook requires
3. **Review content**: Ensure all content complies with Facebook's policies
4. **Contact support**: If issues persist, contact Facebook support

## Page Roles

If you're managing a Facebook page, check your page roles in the Page Settings to ensure you have the appropriate permissions.

**Note:** Grey accounts may have limited posting capabilities until the issue is resolved.
