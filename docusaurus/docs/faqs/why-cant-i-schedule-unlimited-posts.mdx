Social Marketing Standard limits the number of bulk posts to **20** at a time. Social Marketing Pro users can, however, schedule an **unlimited** number of posts at once.

So, if you do need to schedule more posts for your client, you may want to consider upgrading to the Pro version of Social Marketing.
