As per Facebook's API, Instagram and Facebook Accounts are limited to 25 API-published posts within 24 hours. Instagram may flag you as a spam account, and posting over the limit of 25 can trigger Instagram's API into thinking that your account has been hacked. It can result also result in a decreased reach and eventually being banned from the platform.
