# Why did my social post fail?

A post may fail if a user's connection to a social network has expired. This is sometimes referred to as a "broken token" error.

When the connection between a social network and Social Marketing expires, a user with the login credentials for the affected social network must [reconnect](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-social-marketing/vendasta-products-social-marketing-faqs/how-to-reconnect-social-accounts) their account in Social Marketing.

There are two ways to repair an expired connection:

1. Go to **Social Marketing > Settings > Connect Accounts**, click **â‹®** (**Options**) on the affected account, and click **Reconnect**.
2. If a user has been removed or had their permissions changed, remove the affected user or page and [reconnect](/vendasta-products/vendasta-products-social-marketing/vendasta-products-social-marketing-faqs/how-to-reconnect-social-accounts) the page under a different admin.
