You may encounter the following error when they attempt to make a Local Post from your Google Business Profile account in Social Marketing:

*"This location belongs to a chain. The Local Post API is disabled for this location."*

Since the Google Business Profile API prohibits chain locations from making Local Posts, you may encounter this error if Google's algorithm identifies a business as part of a chain. If you encounter this error, you must log in to Google Business Profile directly in order to make a Local Post.
