Some users may encounter the following error when they attempt to make a Local Post from their Google Business Profile account in Social Marketing:

*"This location belongs to a chain. The Local Post API is disabled for this location."*

Since the Google Business Profile API prohibits chain locations from making Local Posts, users may encounter this error if Google's algorithm identifies a business as part of a chain. Users who encounter this error must log in to Google Business Profile directly in order to make a Local Post.
