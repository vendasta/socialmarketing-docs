## View Scheduled and Draft Posts at a Glance

The calendar view gives you a **month-long overview** of all your social posts:

- **Scheduled posts** appear with the exact time they’ll be published.
- **Draft posts** are also visible, helping you track what’s in progress.
- Quickly spot gaps in your content schedule or areas where adjustments may be needed.

You can also toggle between **Month**, **Week**, or **Day view** depending on how granular you want your planning to be.

## Create a New Post from Any Date

To start a new post, simply **click on any date** in the calendar. This will open the post editor, allowing you to:

- Choose the platform(s)
- Add your content, images, or links
- Schedule it immediately or save it as a draft

This helps streamline your workflow without needing to navigate away from the calendar.

## Share Your Calendar with Others

Need to share your content plan with your team, clients, or stakeholders?

Use the **Create report** option in the top-right corner of the calendar tab. This will generate a summary of your content schedule that can be shared via live link—perfect for collaboration, transparency, and approvals.

## Flexible View Options

You can switch between:

- **Monthly view** for a big-picture plan
- **Weekly view** for medium-range planning
- **Daily view** when you want to focus on a single day’s activity

These flexible layouts let you adjust how you manage and review your content schedule.
