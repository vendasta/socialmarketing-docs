## Customization Tips

### For Seasonal Businesses
Adjust the frequency during slower seasons and ramp up during peak times. Store successful posts from busy seasons to reuse next year.

### For Multi-Location Businesses
Clone the calendar for each location and customize neighborhood references, team spotlights, and local offers.

### For Limited Resources
Start with the Google Business Profile posts only (they require the least production) and add other platforms as you build momentum.

### For Content Creation
Batch similar content types together:
- Schedule one "photo day" per week to capture multiple before/afters, team portraits, or product shots
- Record 3-4 short videos in one session to cover a month of Reels
- Write all captions for the week in a single sitting

## Next Steps

1. **Download or copy** your chosen calendar
2. **Set up scheduling** in your social media management tool
3. **Create assets** — Start building your library of photos, videos, and graphics
4. **Track performance** — Note which post types drive the most engagement and bookings
5. **Iterate monthly** — Keep what works, drop what doesn't, and test new ideas
