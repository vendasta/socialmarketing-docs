# Social Calendar Examples

These industry-specific 4-week social calendars provide ready-to-customize content plans. Each calendar includes post ideas, platform recommendations, suggested media, CTAs, and goals to help you maintain a consistent, strategic social media presence.

## How to Use These Calendars

1. **Choose your industry** — Select the tab that best matches your business type
2. **Map to your dates** — Replace "Day" numbers with actual dates from your calendar
3. **Customize content** — Swap bracketed placeholders like `[Product Name]`, `[Staff Name]`, or `[Neighborhood]` with your actual information
4. **Adapt to your brand** — Adjust tone, timing, and platforms to fit your audience
5. **Add tracking** — Tag CTAs with UTM parameters to measure performance

:::tip
These calendars are designed to be starting points. Feel free to mix and match post ideas across industries or adjust the posting frequency to match your capacity.

## CTAs: how to implement by platform

There is a CTA column in the calendar examples that specifies the "Call-to-Action" to include in your posts. How you implement your CTA will depend on the platform you are using.

You can use the guidelines below to help you implement your CTA in the most effective way for each platform.


<Tabs groupId="cta-platform">
  <TabItem value="facebook" label="Facebook (Feed/Page posts)" default>

  - Links are clickable in captions. Include the CTA close to your link!
  - Our link shortener can be used to shorten your URL and keep your post clean and readable.
  - Good pattern: "Book now → https://example.com/book"

  ![Facebook CTA Example](./img/facebook-cta-example.png)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="instagram" label="Instagram (Feed & Reels)">

  - Links in captions are not clickable. Instead, use a non-link CTA like "Tap our profile link to book" or "DM us to book" in your captions.
  - Use [clickable.bio](../tools/clickable-bio.mdx) to help users navigate to your website or store based on a post. Reference it in your caption: "Tap our profile link for details".
  - For Reels, reinforce the CTA with on-screen text and the caption (e.g., "DM to book" or "Tap profile link").

  ![Instagram CTA Example](./img/instagram-cta-example.png)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gbp" label="Google Business Profile (Posts)">

  - Choose one of the built-in buttons: Book, Call, Order online, Buy, Learn more, or Sign up.
  - Add the destination URL or phone. This button is the primary CTA.

  ![Google Business Profile CTA Example](./img/gbp-cta-example.png)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Next Steps

1. **Set up scheduling** in your social media management tool
2. **Create assets** — Start building your library of photos, videos, and graphics
3. **Track performance** — Note which post types drive the most engagement and bookings
4. **Iterate monthly** — Keep what works, drop what doesn't, and test new ideas
