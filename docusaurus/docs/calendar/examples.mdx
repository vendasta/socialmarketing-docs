## CTAs: how to implement by platform

There is a CTA column in the calendar examples that specifies the "Call-to-Action" to include in your posts. How you implement your CTA will depend on the platform you are using.

You can use the guidelines below to help you implement your CTA in the most effective way for each platform.


<Tabs groupId="cta-platform">
  <TabItem value="facebook" label="Facebook (Feed/Page posts)" default>

  - Links are clickable in captions. Include the CTA close to your link!
  - Our link shortener can be used to shorten your URL and keep your post clean and readable.
  - Good pattern: "Book now ‚Üí https://example.com/book"

  ![Facebook CTA Example](./img/facebook-cta-example.png)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="instagram" label="Instagram (Feed & Reels)">

  - Links in captions are not clickable. Instead, use a non-link CTA like "Tap our profile link to book" or "DM us to book" in your captions.
  - Use [clickable.bio](../tools/clickable-bio.mdx) to help users navigate to your website or store based on a post. Reference it in your caption: "Tap our profile link for details".
  - For Reels, reinforce the CTA with on-screen text and the caption (e.g., "DM to book" or "Tap profile link").

  ![Instagram CTA Example](./img/instagram-cta-example.png)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="gbp" label="Google Business Profile (Posts)">

  - Choose one of the built-in buttons: Book, Call, Order online, Buy, Learn more, or Sign up.
  - Add the destination URL or phone. This button is the primary CTA.

  ![Google Business Profile CTA Example](./img/gbp-cta-example.png)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Next Steps

1. **Set up scheduling** in your social media management tool
2. **Create assets** ‚Äî Start building your library of photos, videos, and graphics
3. **Track performance** ‚Äî Note which post types drive the most engagement and bookings
4. **Iterate monthly** ‚Äî Keep what works, drop what doesn't, and test new ideas
