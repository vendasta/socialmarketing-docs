# Instagram Customer Comments

Users of **Social Marketing Pro** can monitor posts that their business profile has been tagged in on **Instagram**, **Facebook**, and **X**—all from within the Social Marketing platform.

## Why This Matters

Understanding what customers are saying about your clients is essential for effective social media management. By automatically pulling in these posts, users no longer need to manually log into individual social platforms to track brand mentions or engagement.

## How Do Customer Comments Work?

To enable this feature:

1. Go to Social Marketing > Settings > Connect Accounts
2. Connect your **Instagram**, **Facebook**, or **X** business profile  

> Note: The connected account must be a **business profile**.

Once connected, Social Marketing will begin pulling in any posts that **tag the business’s handle**, whether in the **caption** or in a **comment**.

---

## Where Will These Comments Appear?

- Under the **Comments** section in the Tools tab of Social Marketing  
- In the **Activity Stream** inside **Business App**  
- If using **Task Manager**, a corresponding task will be created automatically

## Availability

✅ This feature is included with all **Social Marketing Pro** accounts.
