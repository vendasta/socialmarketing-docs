## Link Performance

The **Link Performance** dashboard tracks the number of clicks on shortened URLs used in your social posts. This allows you to evaluate how well different platforms and campaigns drive traffic to your website, landing pages, or other digital destinations.

### What’s Included:
- **Shortened Link Tracking**: Automatically tracks click-throughs on links created using Social Marketing’s link shortener.
- **Traffic Source Attribution**: Clicks are broken down by source—Facebook, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Google, and “Other.”  
  - “**Other**” often includes *Dark Social* sources like email, messaging apps, or unknown referrals.
- **Historical Overview**: View the performance of links over time, categorized by posted date.

> Note: This feature is available with Social Marketing Pro.

## Post Performance

The **Post Performance** section provides in-depth analytics on the social posts you’ve published through the Social Marketing platform—and in some cases, posts created outside the platform.

### Key Metrics Tracked:
- **Reach** – The number of unique users who saw your post.
- **Engagement** – Includes likes, comments, shares, clicks, and reactions.
- **Impressions** – Total number of times your post was shown.
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** – The percentage of viewers who clicked your post.
- **Engagement Rate** – The percentage of viewers who engaged with your content.

> This data helps you refine your posting strategies by identifying what types of content and publishing times generate the strongest results.
