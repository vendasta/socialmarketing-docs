- **What it means:** The Facebook connection is expired or incomplete.
- **Fix it:**
  - Go to **Social Marketing > Settings > Connections**
  - Click **Reconnect** beside Facebook
  - Log in and accept all requested permissions
  - Select and connect the right Pages

#### 2. "You do not have permission to create posts"
- **Fix it:**

  - Check **Page Roles** under Facebook Page > Settings

#### 3. "Connected Facebook account has expired"

#### 5. (#100) API permissions error

- Run your post through Facebook's [Link Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) to see what’s being flagged
- Avoid spammy links or flagged language

#### 7.  Grey Facebook account

A grey Facebook account typically indicates that the account has limited functionality or is in a restricted state. This can happen for several reasons:

## Common Causes

- **Account verification issues**: The account may need additional verification
- **Policy violations**: The account may have violated Facebook's community standards
- **Suspicious activity**: Facebook may have detected unusual activity
- **Incomplete setup**: The account may not be fully configured

## How to Resolve

1. **Check account status**: Log into Facebook and check for any notifications or warnings
2. **Complete verification**: Follow any verification steps Facebook requires
3. **Review content**: Ensure all content complies with Facebook's policies
4. **Contact support**: If issues persist, contact Facebook support

## Page Roles

If you're managing a Facebook page, check your page roles in the Page Settings to ensure you have the appropriate permissions.

**Note:** Grey accounts may have limited posting capabilities until the issue is resolved.

## General Posting Failures

### Post Failed to Publish
- Most often caused by an **expired social token** (broken token)
