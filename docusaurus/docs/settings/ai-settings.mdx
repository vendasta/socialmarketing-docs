# AI Settings in Social Marketing

The **AI Settings** feature in **Social Marketing Pro** empowers users to create high-performing, brand-aligned social media content with greater ease and efficiency. By configuring AI instructions and knowledge settings, you help Social AI better understand your business and generate posts that are relevant, consistent, and on-brand.

This article will walk you through the two key components of AI Settings:

1. **Common Instructions for Post Campaigns**  
2. **AI Knowledge Base**

## 1. Common Instructions for Post Campaigns

Common instructions allow you to guide AI content generation for single-location social posts and bulk campaigns.

### Why Use Common Instructions?

Providing high-level instructions helps AI understand your business context, leading to:

- Better quality social posts  
- Fewer editing rounds  
- Adherence to brand voice  
- Time saved on content creation  

### How to Add Common Instructions

> **Note:** Common Instructions are available under **Settings** in the **single-location social composer** for PRO accounts.

1. Navigate to **Settings > AI Settings**
2. Locate the **"Common Instructions"** text box
3. Enter descriptive, full-sentence instructions that describe your business and its tone  
   - ✅ **Do** write in complete sentences  
   - ❌ **Don't** use bullet points, titles, or subheadings  
4. Click **Save**
5. A confirmation message will appear at the bottom of the page

Once saved, these instructions will automatically be used in:

- **Write with AI** prompts  
- **Post Campaigns (Bulk Create)** content generation

## 2. AI Knowledge in Social Marketing

The **AI Knowledge** section allows you to enrich Social AI with specific business information from multiple sources. This dramatically improves the relevance and personalization of the content Social AI creates.

### Sources of AI Knowledge

You can add knowledge from:

- Your **Business Profile**  
- Your **Website**  
- **Custom Text** inputs  

These sources are used by Social AI during:

- **AI Chat interactions**  
- **Post Campaigns**  
- **Bulk Create workflows**

### How to Add AI Knowledge

1. Go to **Settings > AI Settings > AI Knowledge**
2. Click **"Add Knowledge"**
3. Choose your source:
   - **Business Profile and Website Knowledge** (suggested automatically)
   - **Add Custom Knowledge** via:
     - Website URL  
     - Direct text input  

### Website Knowledge Configuration

If using a website, configure:

- **Name** and **URL**  
- **Crawl Mode**:
  - **Single Page** – just one page  
  - **Follow Links** – up to 100 linked pages  
  - **Site Map** – AI will discover pages via sitemap or attempt to locate one  

Next, click **Next** to let AI discover content. You can then:

- Review the pages found  
- Select which ones to train AI with  
- Click **Save** to confirm  

### Applying the Knowledge

After saving, return to **AI Settings** and confirm your changes. AI will now use this knowledge when generating content in:

- **Write with AI**  
- **Post Campaigns**

## Important Notes

### Shared Knowledge Across AI Assistants

Social Marketing shares its AI Knowledge base with other AI Assistants such as:

- **Web Chat AI Assistant**

If AI Knowledge is updated in Social Marketing:

- It automatically syncs with the Business App’s AI Knowledge Base  
- You’ll be alerted if the update affects other AI tools  

> To use the same knowledge in the **Web Chat AI Assistant**, you must **manually add it** in the Web Chat settings.

### Managing or Deleting AI Knowledge

Currently, knowledge added through Social Marketing **cannot be deleted directly** from within the platform.

To remove knowledge:

1. Go to **Business App Center > Administration > AI Settings > AI Knowledge Base**
2. Select **Manage Knowledge**
3. Click **Delete Knowledge**

## Summary

The **AI Settings** in Social Marketing help you deliver smarter, more effective social media content through two main tools:

- **Common Instructions** for campaign-level guidance  
- **AI Knowledge** for deeper understanding of your business  

With thoughtful configuration, you’ll get highly relevant, brand-consistent content that requires minimal editing and drives better engagement.
