#FAQs 

<details>
<summary>Can I remove a connected individual LinkedIn account without affecting the business page?</summary>

No, when you remove the personal LinkedIn account that was used to connect the business page, the LinkedIn business page will also be removed automatically. This is because the business page connection relies on that individual account's credentials.

**To distinguish between account types in Social Marketing:**

- Navigate to **Settings > Connect Accounts > LinkedIn**.
- Entries labeled **"Page"** represent LinkedIn business pages and their URLs include the word "company".
- Entries labeled **"Account"** represent personal profiles and do **not** include "company" in the URL.

However, **you can remove a LinkedIn business page** from Social Marketing **without affecting the connected personal account**.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I connect multiple Google Business Profile pages or switch between them?</summary>

Due to limitations imposed by Google Business Profile, **only one GBP location can be connected at a time** in Social Marketing.

If you attempt to connect a second location through the **Edit Connections** flow, you'll receive the following error:

 > You can only have one GBP location connected per account.

**To switch to a different GBP page:**

1. Go to **Settings > Connect Accounts** in Social Marketing.
2. Click the **Remove** button beside the current GBP connection.
3. After disconnection, return to this page to connect the new GBP location.
