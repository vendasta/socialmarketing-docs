### **What is the Overview Page in Social Marketing?**

On the **Overview** page, Social Marketing users can see more information regarding their scheduled posts, post-performance, and customer posts. Users can also see how many scheduled posts are coming within the next 30 days, how many engagements their posts have received within the past 30 days, and how many more customer posts have been made by their fans.

Having more social data on the Overview page allows users to get a better understanding of how their social media strategies are performing at a glance.

Social Marketing users simply need to compose and post/schedule social media posts to see these analytics.
